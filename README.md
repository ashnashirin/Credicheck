# CrediCheck 🔍

CrediCheck is a tool that helps students evaluate internship listings by assigning a credibility score based on multiple trust and risk factors.

It is designed to help students quickly distinguish between legitimate internships and those with misleading claims, hidden fees, or poor credibility.

## Why CrediCheck?

Internships are one of the most important ways students gain real-world experience by working in environments similar to full-time roles. However, the lack of clear regulation and standard definitions around internships has led to a rise in misleading and fraudulent listings.

Common issues seen in internship listings include:
- Fake claims of collaboration with brands or companies  
- Unrealistically high pay or guaranteed placement promises  
- Paid training programs presented as internships  
- Large charges under labels such as registration, certification, or training fees  
- Communication limited to WhatsApp or personal contact numbers  

As a result, many students end up paying significant amounts for opportunities that offer little or no real-world exposure.

Currently, verifying an internship requires:
- Checking multiple platforms  
- Reading scattered reviews  
- Relying on personal judgment  

This process is time-consuming and inconsistent.

CrediCheck simplifies this by consolidating common credibility checks into a single score, along with a clear explanation of why an internship is considered safe, risky, or requires caution.

## How It Works

The user provides:
- Company name  
- Internship link  
- Optional description or notes  

CrediCheck analyzes the listing using predefined credibility factors and generates:
- A credibility score from 0 to 100  
- A risk label such as **Safe**, **Caution**, or **Risky**  
- A breakdown explaining the factors influencing the score
